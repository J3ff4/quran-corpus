# STATUS

Live scratch board. Caveman. Update as things move. Not governance (that = CLAUDE.md).
Drifts stale between sessions/accounts — verify anything below against `git log`/
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <c> main`/`gh pr list --state all` before trusting it.
(This file was found stale 2026-07-18: claimed phase-07b search "T11 pending" and
hamza-seat "ready to merge" when both had been merged for days, one iterated further
since. Full rewrite below reflects re-verified ground truth as of today.)

Updated: 2026-07-24

## Now
All work below confirmed via `gh pr list --state all` + `git merge-base --is-ancestor`,
not carried over from prior narrative.
- PRs #1–50 all MERGED into `main`. Current tip `c95626c` (bookmarks-flash fix, #48).
- PR #49 (concordance derived-form filter chips) + PR #50 (alef-madda NFC fix,
  found+fixed live via phone testing; also fixed an unrelated App Router
  remount bug on `/dictionary/[root]`, see [[app-router-dynamic-route-remount-gotcha]])
  both merged 2026-07-24.
- **Russian translations (2026-07-24):** turns out NOT actually empty — Kuliev
  (6236 rows, translator "Elmir Kuliev") was already in the DB via
  `packages/scraper/tools/import_alqurancloud.py`, a phase-01/02 one-shot
  scaffold script pulling from `api.alquran.cloud` (not Tanzil/QuranEnc — its
  license/attribution has never been verified per CLAUDE.md §10/PRD §3.3).
  Added a second Russian translation on top: QuranEnc's "Rowwad Translation
  Center" (`russian_rwwad`, 6236 rows) via the existing `import-quranenc` CLI,
  properly licensed/attributed. **Neither is visible in the app yet** — no
  language switcher exists; the reader hardcodes English (`AyahView`/
  `getTranslationsByAyah` only ever called with `language_code: 'en'` anywhere
  in `apps/web/src`). User decided: keep both translations in the DB as-is,
  verify Kuliev's alquran.cloud licensing before a language-switcher feature
  ever makes it user-facing.
- Bookmarks-flash bug fix (#48): found this session (user report: opening
  /bookmarks briefly flashed "Surah 2 255"-style id-based names before
  correcting to real ones, "couldn't catch it, flashes and switches to normal").
  Root cause: `BookmarksView`'s effect treated an aborted `/api/surahs` fetch
  identically to a real failure — both hit the same `catch { setRows(buildRows()) }`,
  rendering id-based fallback names via the still-empty name map. React Strict
  Mode (dev only) double-invokes the mount effect (mount→cleanup→mount); the
  first request is always aborted by the cleanup, hits that catch, renders the
  flash — the second (surviving) request then resolves for real and corrects
  it. Fix: catch block now bails on `AbortError` without touching state (a
  fresh request already supersedes it); genuine failures (offline) still fall
  back to id-based names so bookmarks aren't dropped. Regression test
  reproduces the exact Strict Mode race (verified it fails pre-fix, passes
  post-fix). Greptile P2 (fake timers only restored after assertions succeeded,
  leaking into later tests on failure) — fixed by moving `vi.useRealTimers()`
  into the shared `afterEach`. Confirmed dev-only trigger (Strict Mode
  double-invoke never happens in prod builds), but underlying abort-vs-failure
  bug was real regardless of trigger.
- Segment-pill redesign + DET hidden (#47): DONE, merged, this session. User
  wanted individual-word-view fix (joined word, pills below) applied to wbw
  list/card views too: `SegmentPills` reworked so segments render as adjacent
  joined Arabic spans (correct letter-joining, no boxes) with POS labels in a
  separate flex-wrap pill row below — `SegmentedWord` (word-detail hero) now
  delegates to `SegmentPills` at `size="lg"` instead of duplicating the layout
  (this reverses part of #46's split, since both views converged back to the
  same treatment). Also: `posColor()` returns `null` for `DET` — corpus.quran.com's
  own wordbyword.jsp doesn't surface an assimilated determiner prefix as its
  own tag either (folded into the preposition's label) — so DET gets no pill
  and no syntax-column line at all (not just muted-gray; fully hidden), while
  its glyph still renders plain-colored as part of the joined word. Also
  small unrelated fix bundled in: wbw page's surah frame had no bottom margin,
  sat flush against the "<Surah> · word by word" caption — added `mb-3`.
  Greptile: pass (no comment findings). NOTE: mid-session, switching branches
  to build #48 on a clean `main` base caused the dev-server working tree to
  temporarily lose #47's uncommitted... no, *committed-but-unmerged* changes,
  which looked like a regression to the user twice (once before #47 merged,
  once after rebasing #48) — not a real revert, just branch-switch visibility;
  worth remembering that unmerged sibling PRs don't coexist in one working tree.
- Reader/word-detail UI polish (#46): DONE, merged. 4 fixes from user
  screenshots: (1) popover Arabic glyph no longer sits under the close button
  (text-4xl + pr-10); (2) Lane's Lexicon "/"-joined text (e.g. abandon/desert/quit)
  no longer overflows its card — break-words CSS + normalize_slash_spacing() at
  import, live DB's 1,386 root_definitions backfilled (633 changed); (3)
  SegmentedWord's SVG per-segment POS labels overlapped (positioned by glyph width,
  not label width) — rewrote to delegate to SegmentPills (same pill wbw list-view
  uses) at a new size="lg", SVG measurement code deleted; (4) `words.pos_tag` was
  the FIRST segment's POS (often a prefix, e.g. "EQ") instead of the STEM's ("V") for
  25.6% of words (19,797/77,429) — fixed both scraper paths (corpus_morphology.py +
  corpus_parser.py, the latter being the one that actually wrote live values) and
  backfilled words.pos_tag directly from word_segments (19,797→485 mismatches, the
  485 being genuine ambiguous double-stem compounds like مِمَّا, not a bug). Greptile:
  pass.
- Full Analysis grammar_note fix (#45): DONE, merged, this session. Word-detail page's
  "Full Analysis" collapsible had the SAME garbled `grammar_arabic` bug #44 fixed in the
  list view (case/verb-form term glued to spelled-out root letters) — #44 wrongly left
  it untouched assuming it was a different, correct use. `WordDetailView.tsx` now passes
  `word.grammar_note` (already selected by `getWordDetail`) to `FullAnalysis`, one line
  per `\n`-clause. `grammar_arabic` confirmed (grep) to have zero remaining UI consumers
  — left as-is, dormant, user's call. Greptile: pass.
  Recent chain: #48 (bookmarks-flash, open) → #47 (joined-word segments + DET
  hidden) → #46 (reader/word-detail UI polish) → #45 (Full Analysis fix) →
  #44 (grammar_note correct-source fix) → #43 (shrink morphology col) →
  #42 (phase-16 per-segment color-coding) → #41 (sajdah mark) → #40 (wbw list view +
  go-to-verse) → #39 (search nav/uz fixes) → #38 (drawer menu + bookmarks) → back
  through phases 06–01.
- Global search (#6): DONE, merged long ago — iterated further afterward (greptile
  fixes on `fix/greptile-search-findings`, a search-sheet consolidation pass). The old
  "T11 review pending / T12 next" note here was stale; ignore, it already shipped.
- Hamza-seat fix (#34): DONE, merged, confirmed (`b0ec7cc` is an ancestor of main).
- WbW grammar-note fix (#44): DONE, merged, this session. New `words.grammar_note`
  column sourced from `wordbyword.jsp`'s `arabicGrammar` div (list-view 3rd column) —
  old `grammar_arabic` column (word-detail "Full analysis") untouched, still scraped
  from `wordmorphology.jsp` prose. Greptile 4→5/5 after 2 fixes: added a self-healing
  `ALTER TABLE` for `grammar_note` on the TS side (`packages/data/src/migrate.ts`,
  mirrors the scraper's own `_migrate_add_word_columns`) + accepted-tradeoff reply on
  the `COALESCE` staleness finding (matches sibling optional fields, kept as-is).

## Data DB (`/home/claude/quran-data/quran.db`, ~113MB; several `.bak` snapshots)
Re-queried directly 2026-07-22 (do not trust older counts in this file's history):
- `words` (77429 rows): transliteration 77429/77429 ✓. morphology_description
  77429/77429 ✓. grammar_arabic 70125/77429 — remaining 7304 are legitimate bare-particle
  cases (no case/construction to label on the source page), not a bug — see
  [[qurandev-roots-source-decision]] / word-detail-single-segment-parser-gotcha memory.
- `grammar_note` (new, #44): 77429/77429 ✓ — full backfill via `scraper scrape` with a
  fresh checkpoint (`.superpowers/sdd/grammar_backfill_checkpoint.json`, 114/114
  chapters). **Footgun found+fixed same session**: that re-scrape also wiped
  `text_arabic` to `''` for all 77429 rows (scraper always writes `text_arabic=""`,
  meant to be patched by a later step, but `upsert_word`'s `ON CONFLICT` overwrites it
  unconditionally instead of `COALESCE` like `grammar_note` does) — repaired via the
  existing `scraper derive-word-arabic` CLI (rebuilds from `word_segments`, untouched
  by the scrape). Confirmed clean after: hamza-seat regression test + full suite green.
  **Any future re-run of `scraper scrape` against an existing DB will hit the same
  text_arabic wipe — always follow it with `scraper derive-word-arabic`.**
- `word_glosses`: en 77429/77429 (source=`corpus`) ✓. uz 75539/77429 (source=`mt`) —
  1890-word gap: NLLB-200 returns `''` for short function words ("from"/"except"),
  confirmed in commit `44b9022`. Review round-trip (`review_glosses.py` export_top/
  import_reviewed) exists and was itself bug-fixed but **never actually run** — 0 rows
  with source=`mt-reviewed`.
- `root_definitions`: 1386 rows (qurandev/roots → Lane's Lexicon import). Done.
  "/"-spacing normalized 2026-07-23 (#46, 633/1386 rows changed) so unspaced
  "word/word/word" runs wrap instead of overflowing the card.
- `words.pos_tag`: fixed 2026-07-23 (#46) — was first-segment POS (often a prefix)
  for 19,797/77,429 words; backfilled from word_segments.stem. 485 words (genuine
  double-stem compounds, e.g. مِمَّا) keep a deterministic first-stem pick, not a bug.
  Backup: `quran.db.bak-preslashfix-20260723` (pre both this and the lexicon fix).
- `ru` (Russian) **translations**: 12472 rows now (Kuliev via alquran.cloud +
  Rowwad via QuranEnc, 6236 each) — see "Now" above. `ru` **per-word glosses**
  (`word_glosses`, distinct table from `translations`): still none.
- Concordance derived-form join (lemma text match): spiked across all 1,642
  roots with occurrences — 833 roots with >=1 unmatched occurrence, 49,968
  occurrences checked, 6,768 unmatched (13.5447%). Fallback (`form_id: null`,
  untagged under "All", excluded from every filter chip, never drops the row)
  covers the gap; no backfill needed. See `packages/scraper/tools/spike_form_lemma_alignment.py`.

## Jobs
- `scrape-word-details`: **DONE**. 77429/77429 checkpointed, no longer running. (Was
  78% per an older note in this file — finished since.)

## Housekeeping (found drifted 2026-07-18, not yet cleaned — flagging, no action taken)
- Untracked scratch sitting in the working tree, never committed/gitignored: this file,
  `docs/plans/phase-12-hamza-seat-fix.md`, `.superpowers/` (SDD task briefs/reports/
  review diffs, ~2.3M).
- Stale local branches (already merged via squash — their tips aren't ancestors of
  `main`, just leftover refs): `phase-09-perf-overhaul`, `phase-12-uzbek-wbw-glosses`,
  `phase-13-reader-typography`, `phase-13b-surah-wide-frame`, `feat/phase-06a/b/c`,
  `fix/csp-nonce-static-prerender`, `fix/surah-frame-glyph-centering`.
- Orphan commit chain, reflog-only (no branch, will eventually gc): ends at `18d9e7e`
  "perf(web/search): one canonical search sheet; retire /search page" — an abandoned
  consolidation attempt, never merged. Possibly superseded by the drawer-menu's
  Search-moved-into-menu change. Recover from reflog before it expires if wanted.
- Parked commit `65a7a56` ("fix(scraper): parse number-word and comma totals in root
  pages") still not landed on `main` — landing method still TBD.

## Queue
1. Uz gloss gap (1890 words, all short function words) — in talks with Tasnim
   (user's contact) as of 2026-07-24; may not need the review_glosses.py path.
2. `ru` per-word glosses (wbw translation, the `word_glosses` table — distinct
   from verse-level `translations`, which is done, see "Now" above) — user
   explicitly wants a human/reviewed source, same as the Uzbek approach via
   Tasnim, NOT raw NLLB machine-translation. Holding until that source exists.
   (`translate_glosses.py`/`mt.py`/`db.upsert_uz_gloss` are all Uzbek-hardcoded
   today — would need generalizing to a target-language param if/when an MT
   path for `ru` is ever wanted instead.)
3. Verify `api.alquran.cloud`/Kuliev licensing before any language-switcher
   feature ships (blocks Russian — and re-check the existing `en`/`uz`
   alquran.cloud-sourced rows from the same script too — same unverified-source
   gap may apply to those).
4. Build a translation-language switcher — both `ru` translations exist in the
   DB but are invisible in the app (reader hardcodes `en`).
5. Land parked commit `65a7a56` — ride next scraper PR vs. standalone push, still TBD.
6. Housekeeping above (stale branches, untracked scratch, orphan commit) — cosmetic,
   do whenever convenient.

## Notes
- Uzbek edition = Cyrillic (uz.sodik). Latin variant not done.
- Greptile: trial→free-plan transition already happened 2026-07-16 (50/mo cap) — watch
  usage against that cap going forward.
